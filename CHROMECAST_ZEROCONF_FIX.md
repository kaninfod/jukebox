# Chromecast Zeroconf Fix

## Problem

You were experiencing thousands of these errors:

```
AssertionError: Zeroconf instance loop must be running, was it already stopped?
```

## Root Cause

The issue was with **zeroconf lifecycle management** in the pychromecast service:

1. **Shared Zeroconf Instance**: The same zeroconf instance was being used for both device discovery and the persistent Chromecast connection
2. **Premature Cleanup**: The zeroconf instance was being closed after discovery, but pychromecast background threads still needed it for reconnection attempts
3. **Background Reconnection**: When the Chromecast connection dropped, pychromecast would try to reconnect using the already-closed zeroconf instance

## Solution

**Separated zeroconf instances**:

### 1. **Discovery Zeroconf** (Temporary)
- Created fresh for each discovery operation
- Used only for finding Chromecast devices
- Immediately closed after discovery completes
- Prevents resource leaks from repeated discoveries

### 2. **Connection Zeroconf** (Persistent) 
- Created once when service starts
- Used for the actual Chromecast connection
- Stays alive for the lifetime of the service
- Allows pychromecast background threads to reconnect properly

## Code Changes

### Before (Problematic):
```python
# Same zeroconf used for discovery AND connection
self._zeroconf = Zeroconf()
browser = CastBrowser(listener, self._zeroconf)  # Discovery
self.cast = pychromecast.get_chromecast_from_cast_info(info, self._zeroconf)  # Connection
# Later: self._zeroconf.close() - BREAKS reconnection!
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# Separate instances
persistent_zeroconf = Zeroconf()  # For connection (stays alive)
discovery_zeroconf = Zeroconf()   # For discovery (short-lived)

browser = CastBrowser(listener, discovery_zeroconf)  # Discovery
self.cast = pychromecast.get_chromecast_from_cast_info(info, persistent_zeroconf)  # Connection

discovery_zeroconf.close()  # Safe to close - only used for discovery
# persistent_zeroconf stays alive for reconnections
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Added `_discovery_zeroconf`** separate from `_zeroconf`
2. **Modified `list_chromecasts()`** to use temporary discovery zeroconf
3. **Modified `connect()`** to use separate instances
4. **Added proper cleanup** with `finally` blocks
5. **Added `cleanup()`** method for full service shutdown
6. **Enhanced logging** to track zeroconf lifecycle

## Benefits

- ✅ **Eliminates the error**: No more "Zeroconf instance loop must be running" errors
- ✅ **Proper reconnection**: pychromecast can reconnect when connection drops
- ✅ **Resource management**: No zeroconf instance leaks
- ✅ **Better stability**: More robust connection handling
- ✅ **Debug visibility**: Clear logging of zeroconf lifecycle

## Usage

### Regular Usage (Automatic Cleanup):
```python
service = PyChromecastServiceOnDemand("Living Room")
# Use service...
service.cleanup()  # Call when done
```

### Context Manager (Automatic Cleanup):
```python
with PyChromecastServiceOnDemand("Living Room") as service:
    # Use service...
    pass  # Automatic cleanup on exit
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_chromecast_zeroconf_fix.py
```

This will test:
- Discovery without connection
- Connection and disconnection  
- Device switching
- Context manager usage
- Proper cleanup

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages to confirm proper operation:

```
✅ Discovery zeroconf instance closed successfully
✅ Persistent zeroconf instance closed successfully
```

And the absence of:
```
❌ AssertionError: Zeroconf instance loop must be running, was it already stopped?
```
