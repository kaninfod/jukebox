# Jukebox Documentation (v2)

This folder is the new concise documentation set.

## Layers

1. **User guide**: [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md)
2. **Fresh install + config**: [INSTALL_AND_CONFIG.md](INSTALL_AND_CONFIG.md)
3. **Integrations setup**: [INTEGRATIONS.md](INTEGRATIONS.md)

## Scope and style

- Keep it short and practical.
- Reflect current code/config defaults.
- Add detail only where needed to operate or troubleshoot.

## Notes

- Legacy docs in `docs/` are intentionally not used as source of truth.
- Hardware wiring details marked as **Confirm with owner** should be finalized with your input.
